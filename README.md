#Blackjack Simulator
This is a simple console-based Blackjack simulator written in Java. The game is currently in its testing phase and is planned to eventually become a web application.

##Overview
The game starts with the player having $1000. The player can place bets, and the game continues until the player decides to quit or runs out of money. The game follows standard Blackjack rules.

##Classes
The application is divided into three main classes:

--**BlackjackSim**: This is the main class that runs the game. It handles the game loop, player input, and game logic.

--**Shoe**: This class represents a shoe of cards. It can deal cards and shuffle the shoe when necessary.

--**Hand**: This class represents a player's hand. It can calculate the value of the hand, check for Blackjack, and check if the hand is a bust.

##Testing Phase
During this phase, we are testing the game logic and user interaction in a console environment. We are also refining the game rules and mechanics to ensure a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.

##Future Development
The ultimate goal is to transform this console-based game into a web application. This will involve implementing a user interface, adding multiplayer functionality, and possibly introducing additional features like player accounts and leaderboards.

##How to Run
To run the game, simply compile and run the BlackjackSim class. The game will guide you through the process of placing bets and playing rounds of Blackjack.

##Feedback
As this is a testing phase, any feedback or suggestions for improvement are greatly welcome. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
